generations:
  - name: "First Generation (XE10)"
    start_year: 2000
    end_year: 2005
    description: "The first generation Lexus IS (initially sold as the Toyota Altezza in Japan) marked Lexus's entry into the compact sports sedan segment, challenging established competitors like the BMW 3 Series. Featuring distinctive styling with clear taillight housings (which spawned the 'Altezza lights' aftermarket trend) and a driver-focused interior with chronograph-style gauges. Initially offered in the U.S. as the IS 300 with a 3.0-liter inline-six producing 215 horsepower, paired with either a five-speed manual or five-speed automatic transmission. A SportCross wagon variant was added in 2002, offering additional utility while maintaining the sedan's sporting character. The first generation IS established Lexus's presence in the sport sedan market with a focus on driving dynamics, though it achieved modest sales compared to European rivals."

  - name: "Second Generation (XE20)"
    start_year: 2006
    end_year: 2013
    description: "The second generation IS represented a comprehensive redesign with more distinctive styling, improved performance, and additional model variants. The lineup expanded to include the IS 250 with a 2.5-liter V6 (204 hp) and the IS 350 with a 3.5-liter V6 (306 hp), both initially paired with automatic transmissions (a six-speed manual was available on the IS 250 until 2010). The exterior styling featured sweeping lines and a fastback-like profile, while the interior offered improved materials and more technology features including a touchscreen navigation system. The high-performance IS F joined the lineup in 2008, powered by a 5.0-liter V8 producing 416 horsepower, paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission and featuring track-focused suspension tuning and distinctive styling elements. A hardtop convertible IS C debuted in 2009, offering open-air motoring with a power-retractable hardtop. Safety technology expanded throughout this generation, including Lexus's Pre-Collision System. A facelift in 2010 brought the spindle grille design theme along with LED daytime running lights and interior updates. This generation broadened the IS model range and strengthened its position as Lexus's compact sport sedan."

  - name: "Third Generation (XE30)"
    start_year: 2014
    end_year: 2020
    description: "The third generation IS featured more aggressive styling centered around Lexus's signature spindle grille design, with sharply creased bodywork and a more muscular stance. The interior was completely redesigned with higher quality materials, enhanced technology including a larger infotainment display with Remote Touch controller, and improved ergonomics. The powertrain lineup initially carried over with refined versions of the 2.5L and 3.5L V6 engines, joined by a new IS 300 AWD that used a detuned version of the 3.5L V6. A significant refresh in 2017 brought even more aggressive styling, standard Lexus Safety System+ with pre-collision braking and lane departure alert, and updated infotainment featuring a 10.3-inch display on navigation-equipped models. The high-performance IS F was discontinued, though an F Sport package offered sportier styling and suspension tuning across the range. This generation focused on refining the IS formula with more distinctive design, improved technology, and a better balance between sport and luxury."

  - name: "Fourth Generation (XE40)"
    start_year: 2021
    end_year: null
    description: "The fourth generation IS represents an evolution of the previous model rather than a complete redesign, built on a heavily revised version of the third generation platform with improved structural rigidity, suspension components, and overall dynamics. The exterior styling is more aggressive, with a larger spindle grille, slimmer headlights, and a full-width taillight design. The IS 300 continues with either a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder (rear-wheel drive) or 3.5L V6 (all-wheel drive), while the IS 350 features a more powerful version of the 3.5L V6 producing 311 horsepower. A new IS 500 F Sport Performance model was introduced in 2022, powered by a naturally aspirated 5.0L V8 delivering 472 horsepower as a spiritual successor to the IS F. The interior features updated technology with a standard 8-inch or available 10.3-inch touchscreen that's moved closer to the driver, replacing the previous Remote Touch controller. Lexus Safety System+ 2.5 comes standard with enhanced pre-collision system, emergency steering assist, and adaptive cruise control. The F Sport package is available in multiple tiers, with the top Dynamic Handling Package adding adaptive suspension and other performance enhancements. This generation focuses on driving dynamics and emotional appeal while updating technology and safety features to meet contemporary expectations."
