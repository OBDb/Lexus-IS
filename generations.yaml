    description: "The first generation Lexus IS (initially sold as the Toyota Altezza in Japan) marked Lexus's entry into the compact sports sedan segment, challenging established competitors like the BMW 3 Series. Featuring distinctive styling with clear taillight housings (which spawned the 'Altezza lights' aftermarket trend) and a driver-focused interior with chronograph-style gauges. The Altezza nameplate was used in Japan from October 1998, while the Lexus IS 200 debuted in Europe in January 1999 and the IS 300 arrived in North America in 2000. Initially offered in the U.S. as the IS 300 with a 3.0-liter inline-six producing 162 horsepower, paired with either a five-speed manual or five-speed automatic transmission. A SportCross wagon variant was added in 2002, offering additional utility while maintaining the sedan's sporting character. The first generation IS established Lexus's presence in the sport sedan market with a focus on driving dynamics, though it achieved modest sales compared to European rivals, with North American sales peaking at 22,486 units in 2001."

    description: "The second generation IS represented a comprehensive redesign with more distinctive styling, improved performance, and additional model variants, launching globally in 2005. The lineup expanded to include the IS 250 with a 2.5-liter V6 (153 kW) and the IS 350 with a 3.5-liter V6 (228 kW), both initially paired with automatic transmissions (manual options were available on some markets). The exterior styling featured sleeker, coupé-like contours with a fastback profile and arrowhead motif, while the interior offered improved materials and more technology features including a touchscreen navigation system. The high-performance IS F joined the lineup in 2007, powered by a 5.0-liter V8 producing 310 kW, paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission and featuring track-focused suspension tuning and distinctive styling elements. A hardtop convertible IS C debuted in 2008, offering open-air motoring with a power-retractable hardtop. Safety technology expanded throughout this generation, including Lexus's Pre-Collision System. Facelifts in 2008 and 2010 brought visual and technical updates, with the 2010 refresh introducing the spindle grille design theme along with LED daytime running lights and interior enhancements. This generation broadened the IS model range and strengthened its position as Lexus's compact sport sedan, achieving significant sales growth including over 49,000 units sold globally in its first year."

    end_year: null
    description: "The third generation IS premiered in January 2013 and continues to the present, featuring progressive styling iterations centered around Lexus's signature spindle grille design. The initial 2013-2016 phase introduced sharply creased bodywork and a more muscular stance, with the interior completely redesigned with higher quality materials, enhanced technology including infotainment displays, and improved ergonomics. The powertrain lineup initially included refined versions of the 2.5L and 3.5L V6 engines, with the turbocharged 2.0L IS 200t/300 joining in 2016, plus a hybrid IS 300h model for certain markets. A significant 2017 facelift brought even more aggressive styling, standard Lexus Safety System+ with pre-collision braking and lane departure alert, and updated infotainment featuring a 10.3-inch display. The V6 engines received a 5 hp power increase in 2017. A major 2020 facelift (for 2021 model year) introduced the IS 500 F Sport Performance variant powered by a 5.0L V8 producing 346 kW as a spiritual successor to the IS F, alongside a larger spindle grille, restyled headlamps, full-width taillamps, updated interior technology with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay support, improved suspension with more rigid body structure, and enhanced driver-assistance systems. A third facelift in 2025 (2026 model year) further updated styling and technology. The high-performance IS F was discontinued after the second generation, though F Sport and F Sport Performance packages offered performance-focused variants. This generation focuses on refining the IS formula with more distinctive design, improved technology, and a better balance between sport and luxury."
